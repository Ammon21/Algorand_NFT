## Introduction to web3

Web3 isÂ a future, decentralized phase of internet development, where users become owners. 
This contrasts from the current Web2, which is dominated by large,centralized players that capture 
most of the internet's monetary value. 
Web3 uses block chains, crypto currencies, and NFTs to give power back to the users
in the form of ownership. 

##### Web1 was read-only, Web2 is read-write, Web3 will be read-write-own.
